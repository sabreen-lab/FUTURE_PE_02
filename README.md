# FUTURE_PE_02 — Task 2: Python Code Debugging with Prompt Engineering

Intern: Sabreen Shaikh  
Track: Prompt Engineering (PE) — Future Interns Fellowship  
Task: Use prompt engineering to identify and fix issues in a Python script.

## Overview
This project demonstrates how prompting can assist in debugging and improving Python code.  
The case study includes:
- A buggy Python script  
- A structured prompt chain  
- AI-generated explanations and fixes  
- A final corrected version of the code  
- A short reflection on improvements  

## Files
- buggy_code.py — the original Python script containing errors  
- fixed_code.py — the corrected version  
- prompt_chain.md — the prompts used and the AI outputs  
- case_study.md — summary of the process and results  
- resources.md — references used during the task
